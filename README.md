Currently, this repository is Public for initial feedback. However, within the next month, it will be moved to a Private repo for security and intellectual property protection. We are currently using AI for the UI/UX design, but a dedicated designer will join soon to refine the experience. Along with this transition, the codebase will undergo a major cleanup and restructuring to ensure it is scalable and production-ready. Please note that the current code is a work-in-progress and will be significantly updated soon.
